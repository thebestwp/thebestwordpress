Bitcoin payments are worth more than credit card payments:
- there is no such thing as a fake Bitcoin payment
- no third party is required to accept bitcoin
- settlement is instantaneous
- there are no chargebacks
- received Bitcoin may be used immediately to [pay hosting bills](/z_about/contribute)
- it works when [Rogers is down](https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/40621/interac-adds-backup-supplier-following-rogers-outage)

The right way to accept Bitcoin for payment at a Wordpress/Woocommerce store is to first set up BTC Pay Server.
There is a [great tool](https://docs.btcpayserver.org/Deployment/LunaNode/) to do this for you at LunaNode for a very reasonable monthly cost.

Once you have a BTCPay Server and a Wordpress site doing the [Woocommerce integration](https://docs.btcpayserver.org/WooCommerce/) is very easy.
