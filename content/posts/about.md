> *"thebestwordpress.site is not The Best Wordpress Site"*

The Best Wordpress Site is a hypothetical ideal which no actual client will ever agree to make.

It's not this website.

This website is *about* The Best Wordpress Site.
Despite its many flaws Wordpress is (by far) the most popular platform to build a website on and one of the last holdouts against the trend of just putting everything on Facebook.
Like it or not, we're stuck with Wordpress.

Creating a Wordpress website is easy, but screwing it up is even easier.
This website is one professional's opinion on how to decide whether Wordpress is the right tool for a job, and how best to protect Wordpress in the hostile environment of cyberspace.
 
## About Wordpressâ€¦
> *"thebestwordpress.site is not a Wordpress site."*

At first I built thebestwordpress.site using Wordpress on a VPS origin server behind Cloudflare as a demonstration of what I think is the best way to serve most Wordpress sites.
It was about 24 hours before I realized that Wordpress was the wrong choice for this project because of *me.*

I am drafting a post about who Wordpress is best suited for but the shortlist is basically this:

1.  People who aren't software developers.

Wordpress has a million things that I don't need, it requires constant maintenance and is easily overwhelmed by even the most basic attack.
Even the most stripped-down basic Wordpress install is many orders-of-magnitude larger and more complex than a basic blog needs to be.

I decided that it's more difficult to do Wordpress right than it is to make an equivalent blog using any other means.
Actually building The Best Wordpress Site negates the benefit of using Wordpress.
Basically, if you're buiding a Wordpress site then you must accept that you're not trying to build the best anything.

### Cookies are for monsters
> *"thebestwordpress.site has no cookies."*

I see no need for cookies on this site but they have become so ubiquitous that it's a little tricky to build a modern website without them.
The GDPR pop-ups are so annoying that I just don't feel that cookies are justified on thebestwordpress.site.

Both Wordpress and Cloudflare require the use of cookies and for me this was the deal-breaker that lead me to dump them for thebestwordpress.site.
I don't need analytics, I have server logs.
This site has no advertising and I have no desire to track anyone online.
It doesn't even have any javascript--the dark mode switch and animations are pure CSS.

## About thebestwordpress.site
> *"thebestwordpress.site is 176KB."*

After realizing that Wordpress was the wrong tool for the job I decided to try out a static site generator written in my favourite programming language, go.

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io) is a static site generator which means that this whole site is just a bunch of pre-rendered content.

## About me
I have been working in software for about 24 years now, and I have worn many different hats.
For the past 7 years or so I have been (among other things) the system administrator for a rotating queue of a few dozen Wordpress sites, most small, some medium sized.

This site is a necessary outlet for me to express all of my thoughts on Wordpress that no client ever wants to hear.

> *They ask, "Is Wordpress secure?"*  
> *"Nothing is secure," I cry.*

There will be no contact information listed on this site because the volume of spam would be too high.
Instead of listing an email address I am thinking of letting people contact me in future with a short message by sending a micro-payment on the bitcoin lightning network.
Another option would be to have people do some minor computation, (proof-of-work,) before revealing a contact form, which is a different form of micropayment made directly to your power utility.
