## What the hell does Bitcoin have to do with Wordpress?!

Briefly:
- micro payments (<1Â¢) in place of captcha for contact forms, search
- proof-of-work in place of captcha
- pay for hosting, VPN, CDN, domain
- anon accounts are not tied to an individual
- instant settlement
- no chargebacks
- works when Rogers is down

> Bitcoin is the native currency of the internet.

## Defeat Spam
Bitcoin payments are worth more than credit card payments:
- there is no such thing as a fake Bitcoin payment
- no third party is required to accept bitcoin
- settlement is instantaneous
- there are no chargebacks
- received Bitcoin may be used immediately to pay hosting bills

The right way to accept Bitcoin for payment at a Wordpress/Woocommerce store is to set up BTC Pay Server.
There is a great script to do this for you at LunaNode and the cost is only about $13/month.
LunaNode also takes Bitcoin as payment.



## Myth and Fact

### Bitcoin is destroying the planet
As of Q1 2022 Bitcoin consumes less than 0.2% of global energy production.
The Bitcoin Mining Council produces quarterly reports ([Q1_2022.pdf](https://bitcoinminingcouncil.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/2022.04.25-Q1_2022_BMC_Presentation.pdf)) on the energy consumption of miners which includes data on carbon emissions and the share of mining powered by sustainable energy sources.

### The fees are high and the transactions are slow
There are now several lightning network wallets which are excellent to use for fast micropayments.
