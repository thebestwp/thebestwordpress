# thebestwordpress.site

This repository hosts the source code of [https://thebestwordpress.site/posts/about/](thebestwordpress.site).
Because all the content is in markdown it also [https://github.com/thebestwp/thebestwordpress/blob/main/content/posts/about.md](renders rather nicely in github).

There is a post about [https://thebestwordpress.site/posts/hugo/](how the site and server are built).

It is a very basic static site made with hugo.
This is mainly an exploratory project.
I normally work with Wordpress sites so hugo has been a real breath of fresh air.
