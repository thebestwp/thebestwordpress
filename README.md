# thebestwordpress.site

This repository hosts the source code of [thebestwordpress.site](https://thebestwordpress.site/posts/about/).
Because all the content is in markdown it also [renders rather nicely in github](https://github.com/thebestwp/thebestwordpress/blob/main/content/posts/about.md).

There is a post about [how the site and server are built](https://thebestwordpress.site/posts/hugo/).

It is a very basic static site made with [hugo](https://gohugo.io).
This is mainly an exploratory project.
I normally work with Wordpress sites so hugo has been a real breath of fresh air.
