## thebestwordpress.site

This repository hosts the source code of [thebestwordpress.site](https://thebestwordpress.site).

There is a post about [how the site and server are built](https://thebestwordpress.site/z_about/hugo/).

It is a very basic static site made with [hugo](https://gohugo.io).
This is mainly an exploratory project.
I normally work with Wordpress sites so hugo has been a real breath of fresh air.
